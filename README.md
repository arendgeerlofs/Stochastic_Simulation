# Stochastic_Simulation

This project was created to study the behaviour of different sampling and variance reduction methods on the accuracy of Monte Carlo Integration of the Mandelbrot set.
by studying the different types of methods, it was possible to identify the best method for variance reduction.
All functions for the calculation of the mandelbrot set, Monte Carlo integration and different sampling methods and plots are in functions.py
The code used to calculate the effect of control variates on random sampling can be found control_variates.py
The code can be run using run.py

This project was created by Arend Geerlofs, Mirjam Koedijk and Kevin Schaaf and will not be maintained after 20/11/2023
